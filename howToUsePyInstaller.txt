1. put your icon and the python script file(i.e. the <name>.py) into a new folder(we called the folder 'exe' in our example).  You can actually do this from your main repo folder but it will be cleaner if you created a new directory for it. 
2. you need to install pyinstaller using pip.  Do this in your repo folder while your virtual environment is active(you should be able to see your "virt").  Run ->  $ pip install pyinstaller
3. cd into the new folder you created and run $ pyinstaller.exe --icon=myicon.ico --windowed <name>.py
